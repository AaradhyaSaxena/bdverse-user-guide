# What is the `bdverse` {-}

**<span style="color:red">[To add new figure]</span>**

The `bdverse` is a family of R packages for biodiversity data. We build it to serve as a sustainable and agile infrastructure that enhances the value of biodiversity data by allowing users to conveniently employ R, for data exploration, quality assessment, data cleaning, and standardization. The `bdverse` supports users with and **without** programming capabilities.

* `bdDwC` provides an interactive Shiny app and a set of functions for standardizing field names in compliance with Darwin Core (DwC) format, see [bdDwC section](#bdDwC).

* `bdchecks` is an infrastructure for performing, filtering, creating and managing various biodiversity data checks, see [bdchecks section](#bdchecks).

*  `bdclean` is a user-friendly data cleaning Shiny app for the **inexperienced R user**. It provides features to manage complete workflows for biodiversity data cleaning, from collecting user input in order to adjust cleaning procedures to generating various reports and versions of the data, see [bdclean section](#bdcclean).

We hope that you'll find the guide useful and clear, and welcome your suggestions in the [issue tracker of the user guide](https://github.com/bd-R/bdverse-user-guide/issues).
